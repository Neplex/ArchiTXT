MLFlow
======

MLFlow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment.
With ArchiTXTâ€™s integration, you can effortlessly log experiment executions, traces, and key metrics directly to MLFlow for streamlined monitoring and analysis.

ArchiTXT creates a dedicated MLFlow experiment for logging and every simplification process is recorded as a separate run in this experiment.
This detailed logging allows you to:

- Track the progress and performance of each simplification step.
- Compare different runs to identify the most effective parameters.
- Easily navigate through experiment histories using the MLFlow UI.

Configure MLFlow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tip::

    By default, MLFlow logs experiments to a local directory.
    It is the recommended solution if you just want to try MLFlow.

To connect ArchiTXT to a remote MLFlow tracking server, set the environment variable `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`:

.. code-block:: sh

   export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5000  # Replace with your remote host

You can also set the tracking URI in your Python code:

.. code-block:: python

   import mlflow

   mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://127.0.0.1:5000")  # Replace with your remote host

Run Experiments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ArchiTXT logs experiments to MLFlow as you run them.
Execute your experiments as usual, and ArchiTXT will handle the logging of metrics.

Explore Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Visualize your logged data using the MLFlow web interface.
If running locally, you can start the MLFlow UI by running:

.. code-block:: sh

    mlflow ui

Open your browser and navigate to the default URL (usually `<http://127.0.0.1:5000>`_).
In the web UI, you can review your experiment details and performance metrics.
