# Contributing to ArchiTXT

Thank you for considering contributing to **ArchiTXT**! Your involvement helps enhance the project and benefits the entire community. We welcome contributions in various forms, including bug reports, feature suggestions, code improvements, and documentation enhancements.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

- **Reporting Bugs:** Encountered an issue? Please report it so we can address it promptly.
- **Suggesting Features:** Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? We'd love to hear your thoughts.
- **Submitting Code:** If you're interested in adding features or fixing bugs, consider submitting a pull request.
- **Improving Documentation:** Help us make our documentation clearer and more comprehensive.

## Development Setup

To contribute code or documentation, set up the development environment as follows:

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** Ensure Python 3.10 or higher is installed.
- **Poetry:** We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neplex/architxt.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd architxt
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## Code Quality and Testing

We maintain high code quality and comprehensive testing through the following tools:

- **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)** for code quality and formatting.
- **[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)** to run unit tests.
- **[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):** Integrated with Pytest, for property-based testing.

Both code quality checks and tests are enforced through our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

To reduce the need of back and forth when submitting a pull-request, we use [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/).
Once set up, the pre-commit hooks will automatically run every time you make a commit, ensuring code standards are
followed.

To set them up locally, run:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Meta-Grammar

**ArchiTXT** use ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) to generate a parser/lexer
for the meta-grammar that validates the generated database schemas.
You can view the meta-grammar definition in [`metagrammar.g4`](metagrammar.g4).

If you make changes to the meta-grammar, youâ€™ll need to regenerate the parser/lexer.
To do so, run:

```sh
$ poetry run antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 metagrammar.g4 -o architxt/grammar
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

- **Tests:** Include tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation to reflect your changes.
- **Commit Messages:** Provide clear and concise commit messages using [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).

A gitmoji commit message use the format `<intention> [scope?][:?] <message>` where:
   - `intention` is an emoji (either `:shortcode:` or Unicode format) that express the intention of the commit.
   - `scope` is an optional string that adds contextual information.
   - `message` is a brief explanation of the change.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

- **Code Style:** Ensure your code adheres to our coding standards and passes all pre-commit checks.
- **Tests:** Include tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation to reflect your changes.
- **Descriptive Messages:** Provide clear and concise commit messages explaining your changes.
